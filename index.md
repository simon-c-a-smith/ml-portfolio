## 🚧 Coming Soon: Machine Learning Projects with a Finance Focus

As a Chartered FCSI designated person (CISI) learning machine learning, I’m excited to apply my finance expertise to real-world ML problems. Upcoming projects include:

- 📈 **Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Models**  
  Leveraging LSTM and ARIMA models to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

- 🏦 **Credit Risk Modeling**  
  Building classifiers to assess loan default risk using supervised learning techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

- 🤖 **Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning**  
  Developing reinforcement learning agents to dynamically allocate capital across assets for optimal risk-return balance.

Stay tuned for detailed project write-ups, code, and results!
